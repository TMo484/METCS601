-- Javascript is not strongly typed, meaning you can add multiple data types to a single array


-- Maps are like arrays with keys
---- They are very similar to Object literals
-- You must use new Map()
-- WeakMaps are garbage collected; Maps are not (which can be a problem for memory)

-- Sets are very similar to Maps
---- You cannot put duplicate entries into Sets
