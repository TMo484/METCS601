-- In order to send data to the server, we need to include an id with the element
-- Data is sent using the POST method on Forms


-- Functional expression are the same as declarations
-- When using the document.querySelector you can use:
---- "#***" to select an id
---- ".***" to select a class
---- "***" to select a name

-- document.querySelector has equivalent functions:
---- "document.getElementById()" to select an id
---- "document.getElementsByClass()" to select a class (this returns an array)
---- "document.getElementsByName()" to select a name (this returns an array)
