-- Typescript
    - A superset of Javascript (it covers the entirety of Javascript)
    - Installed by npm
    - Typescript has the extension .ts
    - Compiled by TSC (tsc.exe; TypeScript Compiler)
        - Example:
        tsc Person.ts >> Person.js

    - Basic Expression
        let isOver21: boolean = false;

        -or-

        let isOver21: boolean
        isOver21 = false;

        let foo: number = 123;

    - You don't have to explicitly cast a type, but it is best practice
    - "Any" allows any Javascript type to be assigned to the variable
    - "Void" is basically only used when a function doesn't return anything
    - "Undefined" - something that hasn't been initialized
    - "Null" - something that is currently unavailable
    - Never: an unreachable end point that can't lead anywhere; such as errors
        - Example:
            function error(): never {
                throw new Error("Womp")
            }

    - Interfaces: A contract that an entity should conform to
        - Example:
            interface Account {
                id: number,
                type: string,
                number?: string,
                created: Date
            }

        - readonly vs. const
            - Variables use const
            - Properties use readonly ()

        - Optional properties
            - A question mark in front of the property
        
        ** Interface Signatures

        - Enumerations; a better practice for creating a list of options / constant values
            - Example:
